# Time Expenditures:
<pre>Lab05: Predicted Hours: 30h		Actual Hours:	h		 </pre>

The actual hours recorded on top reflect the time spent for the assignment including the time 
spent in labs. It excludes time spent reading and understanding the lab assignment instructions 
at the beginning of the lab (pre-lab work).

# Examples of Good Software Practice (GSP)
<pre><ins>DRY</ins> :</pre>
DRY is an abbreviation of "Don't repeat yourself". It's a principle of Software Engineering that
has the goal of reducing repetition and redundancy in the coding. Using abstractions and normalization
are advised over redundancy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">[2]</a>.

<pre><ins>Separation of Concerns</ins> :</pre>
This concept is similar to the "divide and conquer" principle where you divide
a big software project into small projects to complete. A software design technique that focuses on separating 
and freeing functionalities of a program is called Modular programming. Making each of the divided small 
projects independent and addressing a separate concern, it'll make it easy to reduce, detect 
and fix the errors. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">[3]</a>

<pre><ins>Good Code Typing Practices</ins> :</pre>
Good coding practices can be listed as: Naming variables with a relevant name, commenting 
in between code lines with a brief explanation if the code is not self-explanatory, creating 
helper methods that can be used multiple times and by other sections.


<pre><ins>Testing Strategies</ins> :</pre>
Unit Testing can be summarized in 3 types of techniques:<br>

1. <ins>Black Box Testing : </ins> In this testing, input, user interface, and output parts are covered.
2. <ins>White Box Testing : </ins> In this testing, functionality, design structure, and code models are covered.
3. <ins>Gray Box Testing : </ins> In this testing, analysis of code performance, relevant test cases,
methods, and functions are covered.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unit-testing-software-testing/">[4]</a>
